Bank Account OOP assignment for Python

## Usage
```bash
python3 bank_account.py
```

## About this project
A simple (and not real!) Banking App to practice working with class methods and attributes in python OOP.

Within the app you can:
- Create a bank account (with full name, randomized 8 digit account number and starting balance)
- See the statement of your account
- Make a deposit, a withdrawal or transfer to another account within the same bank.
- You can also choose to change to another account and perform the same functions
- If you do not create an account, you simply enter a pre-existing account number to perform the same functions on a pre-built account.

User inputs are validated:
Account numbers are randomly assigned when created
Full name must be string and first letter of each word in the name will be capitalized by the progam.

User can exit the program from the main menu.
